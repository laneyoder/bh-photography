## After MP2-B

Good progress. Things to tighten up:

* Use hyperlinks anywhere they'd normally appear but just point them to a temporary page. 
* When you use an image to hold the brand don't forget to capture the crucial text it contains in an `alt` attribute.
* Related, the brand is likely your `h1` so just wrap those images accordingly.
* Great microformatting for the product thumbs!
* Let's just use a single image for the ratings as cool as the symbol is. "Three stars", "Four stars" etc. Good microformatting otherwise!
